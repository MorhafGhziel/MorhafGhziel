# Hey, I'm Morhaf 👋

I'm a frontend developer based in Riyadh 🇸🇦, focused on building fast, clean, and user-friendly web interfaces.

I care about good design, smooth interactions, and writing maintainable code. Most of my recent work is built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. Currently exploring motion, 3D, and animation-heavy UI.

### 🚀 Projects
Here are a few things I've worked on recently:

- [**PromptShare AI**](https://aiprompt-sharing.netlify.app/) – Share and explore AI prompts
